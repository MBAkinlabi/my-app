# CSS Modules & Media Queries
- The same thing I learned in the last lecture.
- If you're using the `React Scripts version 2` or higher, then the only thing you need to do is import like this:
```js
import classes from Person.module.css
```
- And then you need to rename your file to something like this: `Person.module.css`
- That's the only thing you need to do. Nothing else. According to the author, I believe that you don't need to use the `npm run eject` script you did for the version one type.
- Now I can confirm that you don't need to eject anything with react scripts version 2.
