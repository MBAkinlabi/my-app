# Adding and Using Radium
- Because we can't use pseudo (button:hover) for our inline classes because we can't write it like that.
- And we can't do it in the css file (button: dkdkd) because it'll affect all our buttons in the app, we need to install a third-party package to do this.
```shell
npm install --save radium
```
