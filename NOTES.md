# contextType & useContext()
- We talked about context in the last lecture. There's an alternative and elegant way of using in class and also functional components.
- See how instructor use `contextType` in class to make using context even more simpler
- And see how the instructor use the React Hook`useContext()` in functional component to make using context more simple and easy. Wow. This is getting interesting.
