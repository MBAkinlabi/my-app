# Working with CSS Modules
- Instructor doesn't recommend CSS-in-JS like we did before because CSS would be everywhere in JS.
- He personally doesn't like it.
- And now we're going to be using CSS Modules which he said is cooler and better.
- And the process in this lecture can be used with React Scripts 1 version. If it's the React Scripts 2 version, there's an alternative approach to doing it.
```shell
npm run eject
```
- Because I'm using Git, I quickly commit my files because we won't move forward if I don't.
