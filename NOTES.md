# Class-based vs Functional Components
- The author fully compared class-based vs. functional based components
- The author mentioned something called Lifecycle and didn't talk about it. He promised to tell more about it in the next lecture
- The author shows how to use `this.props.` on class-based component and I can see why we might need it. It looks cool.
